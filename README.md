# JavaScript_Intermediate

## Background

The reason why I initiate this project is that I want to review some intermediate JavaScript concepts, such as Asynchronous programming, Object-Oriented Programming、Modular JavaScript etc



## How to use

- Every folder holds all final code and slides and some reference material for the corresponding concept 
- The folder names should generally be self-explanatory but also feel free to simply click around and see which materials are available
